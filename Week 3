Eval for Week 2: 
I switched over to C from Haskell, and just today compiled enough resources to learn efficiently. I have made a small a
small amount of progress on C so far but it is slow going and reletively hard to understand. I began reading Arduino workshop
but was only able to get so far because I had no Arduino board to try anything on. I was able to get an Arduino simulator but
I could only stomach one of the exercises in Arduino Workshop with the simulated board because it sucks.
